Again, nothing to do with ASCII really, but has been requested by a number of you out there. To get special characters to show on an HTML web page, special HTML codes can be used (ascii code or word) and are interpretted by the web browser. These HTML codes are otherwise referred to as html entities, html characters or html symbols.
